# astro-wue

First working version of a Telegram MensaBot http://t.me/astrowue_bot\n
The command /menu will return todays menu of the Mensateria Hubland Nord.\n
\n
To receive the menu every day, type send the /start command.\n
The /stop command cancels the subscription. \n

Most modules are used in simple use cases explained in the Quick-Start-Guides: \n
