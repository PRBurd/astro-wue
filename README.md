# astro-wue

First working version of a Telegram MensaBot http://t.me/astrowue_bot

The command /menu will return todays menu of the Mensateria Hubland Nord.


To receive the menu every day, type send the /start command.
The /stop command cancels the subscription.
  
  
This project is inspired and loosely based on https://github.com/MaxNoe/mensabot/  
  
Most modules are used in simple use cases explained in the Quick-Start-Guides:

* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
